# Database with Python
This project was made as a Python application that interacts with a SQL database to perform CRUD operations. 
The idea was to make a program that would resemble platforms for real estate listings such as Blocket or Hemnet. CRUD operations allow the users to be registered as admins or regular users
in the DB and make appointments for the listings. 
With queries for adding tables and some base data, a foundation was laid to be able to handle the DB using Python.
